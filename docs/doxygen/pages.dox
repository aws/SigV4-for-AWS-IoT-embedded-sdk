@brief AWS Iot SigV4 Utility

<p>
The AWS IoT SigV4 Library is a standalone utility for generating a signature and
authorization header according to the specifications of the AWS Signature Version 4
signing process. This utility is an optional addition to applications sending direct
HTTP requests to AWS services requiring SigV4 authentication. The library is written in C and designed to be compliant with ISO C90 and MISRA C. It has proven safe memory use.

<h3>Memory Usage</h3>
<p>
All functions in the SigV4 library operate only on the buffers provided and use only
local variables on the stack.
</p>

<h3>Compliance & Coverage</h3>

<p>
The SIGV4 library is designed to be compliant with ISO C90 and MISRA C:2012.
All functions are written to have minimal complexity. Unit tests and CBMC proofs
are written to cover every path of execution and achieve 100% branch coverage.
