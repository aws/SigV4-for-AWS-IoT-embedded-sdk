## Building the SigV4 Library

## Building Unit Tests

### Platform Prerequisites

- For running unit tests:
    - **C90 compiler** like gcc.
    - **CMake 3.13.0 or later**.
    - **Ruby 2.0.0 or later** is additionally required for the CMock test framework (that we use).
- For running the coverage target, **gcov** and **lcov** are additionally required.

### Steps to build **Unit Tests**

1. Go to the root directory of this repository.

1. Run the *cmake* command: `cmake -S test -B build -DBUILD_CLONE_SUBMODULES=ON`.

1. Run this command to build the library and unit tests: `make -C build all`.

1. The generated test executables will be present in `build/bin/tests` folder.

1. Run `cd build && ctest` to execute all tests and view the test run summary.
